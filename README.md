Hero Chest
==========

This project is a compilation of scripts to help players and game masters speed
up their pen and paper roleplaying games. In the days where paper was the only
option, turns and actions could take several minutes and leave players
unengaged. Uninterested and unengaged players can make for a bad game. Why not
leave your dice rolls to a computer so you and your friends can focus on what
brought them to the table: Storytelling.

Scripts and functions:
+ Die Caster (die\_cast.py): Type in a string representing a die roll, and the
  function will return the result. E.g: "1d6 + 2" will roll a d6 and add 2 and
  return the result.
